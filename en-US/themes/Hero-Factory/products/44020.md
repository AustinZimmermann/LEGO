Red alert! FLYER Beast, a gigantic skeleton-winged creature is on the loose. It’s been spotted breaking into skyscrapers, using its antenna to locate Antropolis City citizens and grabbing them with its huge poison claws and snapping jaws. BREEZ, zoom into the sky with your powerful jet boots and bring the beast under control with your electro chain. This dangerous beast must be stopped now! Includes BREEZ mini robot with a weapon and accessory.
