Report for duty, FURNO! LEGO® Hero Factory has built a new Jet Machine to help you to overpower the giant beasts and dangerous jumpers causing havoc across the city. Don’t let the speedy little jumpers wreck the Jet – put the heat on them with the flame gun, capture them in the furnace canister and engage the wings to zoom away from the evil enemy. Includes FURNO mini robot with a weapon and accessory.
