Attention, heroes! SPLITTER Beast is a titanic two-headed beast guarding the biggest crevice in Antropolis City where the evil creatures are hiding. EVO and FURNO, we’ve equipped you with a laser lasso. Distract this brute with many eyes using the fire sword and gun while you tie its legs together to bring it down. But beware, it can suddenly split in two and cause double danger to you and the civilians! Includes EVO and FURNO mini robots with weapons and accessories.
