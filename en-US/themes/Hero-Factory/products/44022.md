Go, go, EVO! After the beasts destroyed your Walker, like a true hero you’ve bounced back and built the ultimate XL machine to support the other heroes in battle. The new weapons you’ve created, plus the shooter, flick missiles and rotating machine top will allow you to take on beasts attacking from all angles. You have all the technology, so go and win back Antropolis City for its good citizens once and for all. Includes EVO mini robot with a weapon and accessory.
