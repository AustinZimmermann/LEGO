### 44015 EVO Walker

![](https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/product.img.pri/44015_prod.jpg){width=300px}

Attention, EVO! A massive earthquake has left huge cracks in the streets of Antropolis City. Giant beasts and a wild bunch of evil jumpers are swarming out of the crevice to attack. Power up your walker, lock down the seat visor and go check it out. Use your communication device to call in the other heroes, and fend off the evil invaders with your shooter and razor-sharp saw until backup arrives. Includes EVO mini robot with a weapon and accessory.
